**Extra: Decoration and Exploration Structures**
================================================
The Pokecube adds some decorative blocks and structures for you to explore

Team Rocket's Hideout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Team Rocket's hideout is an underground structure that can be found in the biome: Plains
At first glance it looks like just a simple little house, but it is the gateway to the secret base,for you to unlock the door, you need to place a random item inside a secret chest and then the secret door will open revealing the place where you will go down.
inside the structure you will find several trainers from the rocket team and reaching the end of the structure, you face their boss

Some curiosities:
 * the structure is based on the headquarters of the Red / Blue games;
 * trainers have the pokemon that rocket team trainers have in games;
 * the boss at the end of the base could be Giovanni...

Totens Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Totem blocks are decorative blocks with a very interesting utility.
You can see some in the Temple of the Tapus, but they have their own craft, the totems have 4 formats using the Tapus as reference.

> use the dyes to have color variations for the totems.
	
They also have an offering mechanism, if you deliver an item to the Totem and you receive a potion effect.
The item you offer to the Totem, by default, is a diamond, but you can change that item using datapacks

Strutures
#########

While exploring the world you may find a few different structures, they are the 'Temples of Legendary'. Legendary temples need a key item and a unique quest completed so you can summon it and capture it. But for the most part not all have unique structures, some share the structure.

Making Type: Null
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type: Null is a pokemon created in the laboratory, so there's nothing more fair than creating it inside the Pokecube too :b

The first step is to find Aether Paradise, is the new structure that appears in the oceans:

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/Dgqpt68.png
    :alt: Aether_Paradise

In it, you will find some NPCs to battle, and reaching the top floor you will find the NPC Faba

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/sI7pTSb.png
    :alt: Faba_Pokecube

Defeating him, you can open the trade menu, and there you will find Imprisonment Helmet, the main item to create Type: Null

>Now comes the part you need to pay attention to!
You will need: Potion of Regeneration, Imprisonment Helmet, Two Pokemob egg

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/PXL1Y0K.png
    :alt: typenull_recipe

When items are in place, just power Cloning Divece using a Siphon and an electric pokemob (minimum level: 25)

Summoning Regis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create the Summon the Regi you have chosen you have two options: Search the Temple or Create your Totem
To create the Totem follow the images:

> For the base you will use the Totem block:

    :alt: Keys

> This is true for all blocks that use the key item: if it is out of the correct place of invocation or if it is the block you created and was placed in the wrong place, you will get this message when you try to use a key item in that block.
