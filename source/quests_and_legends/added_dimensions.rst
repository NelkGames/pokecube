Pokecube Dimensions
-------------------

# **|Pokecube| Dimensions:**
|Pokecube| has two dimensions to be explored by players. On this page, we'll see how to get to these dimensions, how they affect gameplay, |Pokemob| exclusive to these locations

# **Distorted World**

Let's start with the simplest. The distorted world is a dimension composed of floating islands. No type of pokemob is found there, other than the Unown.
But of course there is something more here, besides the islands in strange positions, pillars and barriers of mirrors, Giratina is the legendary that can be found in this dimension.
When you find it, it will be in its Original form, but when captured it will return to its standard form (with legs)

>But how do I go to the dimension?

First of all, we need to complete a Quest.
This quest is for you to capture the three guardians of the lake (Mesprit, Azelf, Uxie)
When you have all three, you will automatically win the mirror parts.

This mirror is your gateway to his dimension; But we are not done yet, with the three parts, you need to combine them with a Nether Star
And so you get the full mirror:

Using the mirror is not complicated, just right click and you will be teleported to the dimension
>Attention, the Mirror has an internal cooldown, so you cannot spam the teleport. This cooldown can be changed in the settings, but you have a minimum limit for placing it.

## **Ultra Space**
Ultra Space is a very lively dimension, containing new biomes and some exclusives
But first, let's mine a little.

One of the first steps to going to Ultra Space is to find meteors, but wait, not the ones that explode your map in the beginning, clusters of rocks that appear in Mountain biomes (Extreme Hills and derivatives)
Inside the meteors, you will find a new ore, called Cosmic Ore, this ore can be collected by iron tools. Breaking them, you will get Cosmic Dust, and it is this dust that you will need, and it is better to stock up.

Now that you have enough Cosmic Dust and Meteor Blocks, it's time to create the Ultra Key:

Another way to get Ultra Key is by purchasing from an NPC, specifically, Lusamine. Yes, you can find it at Aether Paradise.
Aether Paradise has two variations:
>one Containing Faba and Type Null item
the other Containing Lusamine and Ultra Key
for both, you need to defeat them, and then the exchanges will be released

**Using Ultra Key**
Now that you have Ultra Key, it's time to use it. With Cosmic Dust in inventory, it will be used as fuel for your key

The Key consumes a specific amount of Cosmic Dust to function, you can see that amount in the Item's ToolTip and it can also be changed in the settings.

And now, right-click, holding the key and you're done, you're now in Ultra Space!

### **Mining and Anomalies**
Now that you're in Ultra Space, be cautious! ALL biomes of this dimension have anomalies in their blocks!

>But let's go by parts, what do you have to explore in Ultra Space?

All! From mining to Capture all UBs

**BIOMES**
There are six biomes in the dimension, and each biome has a unique characteristic, when a unique anomaly.

* Ultra Deep Caves - It is a calmer biome, containing blue trees that give light to the environment, giant mushrooms and unique fungi.
-[Anomaly] Slowness in the players-

* Ultra Jungle - surrounded by tall trees that also emit a weak light, this biome is wide, with floating islands and mountains.
-[Anomaly] Poison in the players-

* Ultra Desert - it is an arid biome with little vegetation, it also has some crystal constructions.
-[Anomaly] Levitate in the players-

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/tsljOLz.png
    :alt: desertc

* Ultra Dark Valley - a biome taken by darkness, with buildings destroyed and brought in from other dimensions, getting lost in this place is very easy
-[Anomaly] Blindness in the players-

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/gBKgXlS.png
    :alt: darkc

* Ultra Deep Hills - it is a valley taken by entities trapped in the blocks you step on, an almost empty place, except for dark energy branches that come out of the ground
-[Anomaly] Fatigue in the players-

* Ultra Forgotten Plains - perhaps the oldest biome in Ultra Space? Its vegetation in shades of yellow bring a feeling that time does not stop.
-[Anomaly] Wither in the players-

**Going down**
Now that you know the biomes, or possibly died in one of them, you feel that you need a way to avoid the anomalies. And that way is to build a costume!
If you start exploring the caves in Ultra Space, on layer 20 you will find the first traces of ores

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/I7REhBe.png
    :alt: ores

Here you can supply yourself with Cosmic Dust and Spectrum Ore and this is the ore we are looking for.
Spectrum Ore is the exclusive ore of the Dimension, with which you can make your armor to avoid the effects of the dimension!

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/7qCJqVS.png
    :alt: ores

To create the armor, only Spectrum is not enough, we also need Magnetic Stone, which are stones that absorb the negative energy of the Ultra Deep Hills biome. Coletalas is not difficult, but the danger is that they activate with the player's interaction.

after collecting these items, we can create the armor.
>the armor only works if it has all the parts in the body, if one part is missing, you are not immune from the effects of the blocks!

### **Beast Cube and UBs**
Finding UBs is not so complicated, but the hard part is getting blankets in basic pokecubes. The best we can do is create BeastCubes!

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/AS24L6V.png
    :alt: cube

The Beast Cube has a higher chance of capture in the dimension or in other dimensions, in the normal world (Overworld) the capture rate is very low.

Several pokemob can appear in Ultra Space, which makes the UBs have their spawn reduced, but does not prevent you from finding several by the biomes.
Facing them can be easy, but you always have to remember that your armor is not repairable, so if it breaks, the pokemobs will have the advantage of the terrain next to them, so always be careful.

and here we have the Spawn list of the UBs:
* Ultra Deep Caves: Nihilego, Blacephalon
* Ultra Jungle: Buzzwole, Poipole
* Ultra Desert: Pheromosa, Celesteela
* Ultra Dark Valley: Guzzlord
* Ultra Deep Hills: Xurkitree, Stakataka
* Ultra Forgotten Plains: Kartana

#FAQ
>if i die in Ultra Space, did i go back to the normal world?

no, you are stuck in the dimension and can only go out using an Ultra Key or Move Teleport with a pokecenter marked in the normal world.

(1.16.4 +) yes, you will return to the normal world.

>Can block effects be used outside Dimension?

yes, the blocks will always have this effect, and only the armor will cancel the effect of these blocks

>Can vegetation be planted outside the dimension?

yes :D

>If I lose Ultra Key, do I have resources in the dimension to get a new one?

no. The only ores that appear in the dimension are Spectrum and Cosmic Ore, so you wouldn't have the meteor rocks to build Ultra Key.

(1.16.4 +)
Since you can return to the normal world if you die, this "danger" is not that great.
