Location Linker
***************

The location linker is an item which is used to link blocks and mobs to locations. When a block is right clicked with this item, one of two things will occur:

1. In most cases, the location of the block will be stored to the linker, it will also be copied to clipboard, so that it can be pasted into certain GUIs.
2. In the cases of blocks which accept links, the link interaction for that block will apply instead.
