Legends and Quests

# **Making Type: Null**
Type: Null is a pokemon created in the laboratory, so there's nothing more fair than creating it inside the Pokecube too :b

The first step is to find Aether Paradise, is the new structure that appears in the oceans:

![Aether_Paradise](https://i.imgur.com/Dgqpt68.png)

In it, you will find some NPCs to battle, and reaching the top floor you will find the NPC Faba

![Faba_Pokecube](https://i.imgur.com/sI7pTSb.png)

Defeating him, you can open the trade menu, and there you will find Imprisonment Helmet, the main item to create Type: Null

>Now comes the part you need to pay attention to!
You will need: Potion of Regeneration, Imprisonment Helmet, Two Pokemob egg

![typenull_recipe](https://i.imgur.com/PXL1Y0K.png)

When items are in place, just power Cloning Divece using a Siphon and an electric pokemob (minimum level: 25)

# **Summoning Regis**
To create the Summon the Regi you have chosen you have two options: Search the Temple or Create your Totem
To create the Totem follow the images:

> For the base you will use the Totem block:

![Totem Base Block](https://i.imgur.com/Lfqfjny.png)

> And to the Top, you will use the Core Blocks:

![Core Blocks](https://i.imgur.com/beFe3aH.png)

![Regirock Totem](https://i.imgur.com/V8op3qw.png)

![Registeel Totem](https://i.imgur.com/sWXwl9x.png)

![Regice Totem](https://i.imgur.com/B6njMyJ.png)
>You can use any type of Ice for the Totem

![Regidrago Totem](https://i.imgur.com/BRWpj47.png)

![Regieleki Totem](https://i.imgur.com/pi7oobL.png)

![Regigigigas Totem](https://i.imgur.com/o39sBZH.png)

>To Activate, simply use the Key Item of your respective Totem

![Keys](https://i.imgur.com/m7pzAdb.png)

> This is true for all blocks that use the key item: if it is out of the correct place of invocation or if it is the block you created and was placed in the wrong place, you will get this message when you try to use a key item in that block.
